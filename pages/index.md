# Hi

I am `657`, a software developer from China. 657 is a homophone of my name in Chinese.

You can contact me by sending an email to kuyermqi@outlook.com. Sometimes I use "Kuyermqi" as my username. "Kuyermqi" is a coined word derived by applying a simple rail fence cipher to the pinyin of my Chinese name. It's unique—though a bit childish, I think it's pretty cool.
